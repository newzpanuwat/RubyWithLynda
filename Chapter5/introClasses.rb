What the class ?

class ClassName  #=> call CamelCase 
    ...
end

Classes will:
    Group the code into discreet, well-categorized areas
    Make the code easier to work with

So why is defining our own objects so important ?, why is a good thing?

    * Organize code ino well-categorized areas
    * "Carry around" their class's code 
    * Allow complex behavoirs using simple statments
    * Correspond to real-world objects
