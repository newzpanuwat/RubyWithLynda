    MODULES: LOAD,REQUIRE AND INCLUDE

    * Modules are usually kept in separate files
    * Modules files can serve as code libralies
    * Need to have a way to load modules into Ruby


    load : loads a source file every time it is called
    require: loads a source file only once
    include: includes modules, nothing to do with files
